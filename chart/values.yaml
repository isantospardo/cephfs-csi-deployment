reclaimDeletedVolumes:
  # We set the grace period of 720h (30 days) for Cephfs PVs in the production cluster,
  # the time units to be used are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
  gracePeriodBeforeDeletingReleasedPV: 720h
  # no point in applying a grace period for a PV if it's deleted right after it's been created.
  # This avoid keeping many PVs around when we have a loop of PVC creation-deletion (this can happen
  # with templates/APBs that fail provisioning)
